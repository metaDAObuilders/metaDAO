description: A simple description of futarchy
---

# TL;DR

The gist of futarchy is essentially:

* Someone raises a proposal to a DAO
* People bet on whether the DAO's token would go up if the proposal passed
* If the market thinks that the token would go up, the proposal passes
* If the market doesn't think that the token would go up, the proposal fails
