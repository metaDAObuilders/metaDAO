Futarchy was invented by economist Robin Hanson in 2000. The basic idea is to make decisions via markets.

It does this through _conditional markets_. In a conditional market, you speculate on what an asset would be worth under a specified condition. Futarchic conditional markets consist of traders speculating on what an asset would be worth if a proposal passed and if it failed.

We can extract the sentiment of traders by looking at these conditional markets' prices. Futarchy then passes proposals when the price of an asset (e.g., a stock for a public corporation or a token for a DAO) in its conditional-on-pass markets is greater than the price of the asset in its conditional-on-fail markets.
